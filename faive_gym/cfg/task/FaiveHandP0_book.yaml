# a simple example of introducing an articulated object
# doesn't learn any actual task, feel free to improve it...

# if you want to get the joint angle of the articulated object, that can be computed by accessing the corresponding indices in self.dof_state
# e.g. if the object is 1 DoF and was loaded (with create_actor) right after the robot
# the object joint position and velocity can be accessed by self.dof_state.view(self.num_envs, -1, 2)[:, self.num_hand_dofs]
